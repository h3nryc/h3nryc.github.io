                <p>One primary difference between print media and traditional print media systems is the dynamic nature of multimedia systems. Once something is printed it cannot be changed, a multimedia system, however, can change to display up to date information or react according the input by the user. Another difference is that multimedia systems are interactive whereas print media has no form of interactivity. </p>
                <p>Answers could also include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The difference in displaying information. Multimedia, unlike print, can be displayed through a wide variety of electronic formats and even be temporarily streamed to the user.</li>
                    <li>Indexing multimedia systems are much easier to index than print mediums.</li>
                    <li>Ease of distribution for multimedia systems compared to print.</li>

              <p>One drastic difference between primary and secondary storage is that primary story is volatile and secondary storage is not volatile. An example of primary storage is Read Only Memory (ROM) and an example of secondary storage is a disk drive.</p>
              <p>Answers could also include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Primary storage is typically faster than secondary storage, is more expensive and holds less storage.</li>
                  <li>Other examples of primary storage: Random Access Memory (RAM) and cache memory.</li>
                  <li>Other Examples of secondary storage: Floppy disks, optical disk, magnetic tape and USB/flash drive.</li>

              <p>Sound is represented as a transverse wave and can be converted to a digital form through the process of sampling. Sampling is essentially the conversion of a sound wave into a signal that can be stored by computers. The sample size refers to the number of bits used to store each sample from an analogue wave. To determine how many samples can be stored in a certain number of bits is found through 2 to the power of the number of bits. For example, an 8-bit sample size can represent 256 possible levels in a particular sample. A higher sample size means more accurate and high-quality sound, however, at the trade-off of larger file sizes. Sample rate refers to the number of samples taken from an analogue wave per second. A typical CD has a sample rate of 44.1KHz or 44,100 samples per second.</p>
